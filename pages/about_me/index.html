        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm <span id="name">Joe</span>, a highschool junior who's interested
          in computers and programming. I've been coding for half a decade,
          learning new things all the time. I fell in love with programming in a
          6th grade coding class, after learning a dumbed down version of Java
          with an online learning service called CodeHS, however, my coding
          roots go deeper than that. In fourth grade I can remember playing
          around with Scratch, making games and simple projects, however I have
          no way of recovering these projects.
        </p>

        <h1>What things do I do?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>I spend my time doing many things, some of these are</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Playing tennis</li>
          <li>Programming projects</li>
          <li>Creating websites</li>
          <li>Blogging</li>
          <li>Going to the gym</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some projects I have worked on are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple life simulation in Python</li>
          <li>
            A game for the Winter MelonJam 2023 game jam
            <ul>
              <li>I worked on this game for 3 days with two other people</li>
              <li>We didn't win</li>
              <li>
                Working on this helped me learn multi-timezone communication
                skills and fixing multiple Git merge conflicts and errors
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A simple game in Construct 3
            <ul>
              <li>
                It was played live by a streamer in front of over 100 people
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            An anonymous social media website, similar to 4chan
            <ul>
              <li>
                I took it down after about a week, since the anonymity was
                abused and I received recommendations that the website I was
                hosting it on wouldn't appreciate the content that was being
                uploaded
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A rudementary programming language built in Python. It was highly
            unoptimized and had very limited functionality
          </li>
          <li>A couple simple Discord bots</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1>Where do I do these things?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Nice try</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h1>When do I do these things?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am currently taking a class at the Careerline Tech Center for
          Software and Game Development, which gives me roughly 3 hours to work
          on assignments and projects for that class. Other than that I devote
          some time from when I get home to work on a passion project or to
          blog.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h1>Why do I do these things?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          I make things like projects and websites because I really enjoy
          problem solving and learning new things. I like seeing the file
          structure and codebase of a project slowly expand, its like a sort of
          clock, showing how the project is increasing in proportion to the time
          I've spent on it.
